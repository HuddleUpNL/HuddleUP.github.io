                  </div>
                <p>HuddleUp kicked off its journey in 2024, when three passionate sports lovers had only one goal in mind: to create a community full of passionate sports players, ready to meet up and play their hearts out together. On our pitch, everyone is welcome to join the dream team! From those humble beginnings, HuddleUp has managed to build a community that's truly all about the thrill of the game, connecting people with fellow sports fans. No matter the sport you play, be it football, basketball, volleyball or something else, we’ve got a spot and a team for you. We’re all about creating special moments, both on and off the field, because we know it’s not just about the wins (although we love those) but also about the connection team players feel between them. So, huddle with us and you’ll have a guaranteed blast together with fellow sports fans! </p>

          </div>
          <div class="detail-box col-md-6 align-middle mt-4">
            <p>Our name came from a simple question: what is something that brings all team players together? Is it the game itself? The sport? Well, it turned out to be something much more personal than that, something only a closely knit team would truly understand and value. Huddling together is what makes the team feel like a singular unit, something that brings all players together and connects them. “HuddleUp” is not only our name, but it is an invitation that we extend to all our users, we invite you all to huddle together and create your dream teams.</p>
