        <h4>Brand Name: HuddleUP</h4>
        <p><b>Explanation:</b> Our name came from a simple question: what is something that brings all team players together? Is it the game itself? The sport? Well, it turned out to be something much more personal than that, something only a closely knit team would truly understand and value. Huddling together is what makes the team feel like a singular unit, something that brings all players together and connects them. “HuddleUp” is not only our name, but it is an invitation that we extend to all our users, we invite you all to huddle together and create your dream teams.</p>
        <h4>Brand Vision</h4>
        <p>Sports is all about excitement, adrenaline pumping through your veins, and uniting communities. As fellow sports lovers we agree with that, and we believe that coming together and reigniting the thrill of the game makes sure divisions remain only in sport leagues. HuddleUP’s vision is of a world where this kind of mindset is just as present off the pitch as it is on the pitch. </p>
        <h4>Brand Values</h4>
        <p><b>Everyone can play:</b> A player’s past should never define their future. Everyone is welcome to huddle up and find a new team to play with, no matter your background and experiences.</p>
        <p><b>Thrill of the Game:</b> The game should not only unite us but inspire us to show our passion for the sport. Experience with us the unimaginable heights of success and the heart-wrenching feeling of defeat.</p>
        <p><b>Growing Together:</b> There’s no I in Team, but there’s an I in WIN. Even if you build your own success, a good team environment is what fuels it. Connect with your teammates and make new friends with HuddleUp. </p>

              #19265B
              <p>The dark blue colour symbolizes power and integrity, and it hints to HuddleUp's goal of unifying team sports players. It gives a sleek appearance to the brand logo and to the website and it creates a nice contrast with the bright orange. <p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #F1610D;"></span>
              #F1610D
              <p>Orange symbolizes enthusiasm and connection, two key aspects of our brand. The brightness of it also adds an energizing touch to our logo, offering it a harder hitting punch. On the website, it was used as an accent color in the navbar and in the buttons, because it is highly visible and eye catching. </p>

            <li>

              #50A5AF 
              <p>This color represents harmony and fellowship, the very core of a good team. It was used as the color of the navigation bar and footer, to symbolize that these values are the beginning and end of everything when it comes to sport and our brand. <p>
            </li>

              #FFF5ED
              <p>The cream color symbolizes control and practicality, something our brand wants to bring to our users through this website. We want people to feel in control of their playing experience, being able to create their own dream teams with the help of our service. This color was chosen as a background color that is only used when a neutral background is needed (mostly in our social media posts), but it is also used as the color of some text. <p>

      <h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h2>
      <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
      <p>HuddleUp is the best friend of all sports players who are looking for others to play with. The brand is all about helping people find their own dream team, and its core values are Thrill of the Game, Equal Access and Growing Together. Through our marketing campaign, we wanted to give our audience that exact feeling of togetherness and belonging that our brand embodies. 

       <br><br> The main goal of our marketing campaign is to spread awareness about our brand and create a strong sense of community among our users, while also creating interest in our new website, that will be launched on the 5th of April. The message that we want to convey, although it is not said directly, is that everyone can find their dream team with the help of HuddleUp. 
        
       <br><br> Our target audience is young people aged between 18 and 25 living in the Netherlands, and we focus on those who are actively engaged in team sports. According to NOC-NSF (n.d), the Dutch organisation for sport, approximately 65% of Dutch people aged five to 80 play sports at least once a week. Out of those 65%, we will focus on the people who are passionate about sports and who actively play a team sport more than once a week, which roughly represent 30% of the Netherlands population (Statista, 2024).  This demographic uses Instagram and TikTok the most (SocialDutch, 2023; Statista, 2024), so these will be the platforms we will use for our marketing campaign. 
         
        
       <br><br> Based on more research on the media platform usage of our target audience, we decided to use Instagram and TikTok to promote our brand. The main demographic using Instagram in The Netherlands is 18-24 which corresponds with our target audience (18-25) (Statista, 2024). Nederpel (2024) also shows that 50% of Dutch users aged between 20-24 use Instagram daily. SocialDutch (2023) also shows that 54% of the demographic 20-39 use TikTok and 8% of the demographic of 13-19 years old. As our target auidence lies somewhere between these two demographics it can be concluded that the majority of them use TikTok. 
      </p>
      <p><b>Marketing Objectives</b><br>

        <b>Reach:</b> By the 1st of April, we want to reach at least 100 new accounts on both Instagram and TikTok. 
        <br>
        <b>Affect:</b> By April 1st , we want to make our users feel excited and motivated to join game sessions, and we will measure this by the excitement shown in the poll responses (minimum of 10 responses). 
        <br>
        <b>Response:</b> The number of followers we want to achieve by the 1st of April 2024 is 100 followers on Instagram. 
        <br><br>
        To measure these objectives, we will closely keep track of Instagram and TikTok analytics (impressions, likes, reach, follower count and growth, views). </p>
      <b>Promotional Activities</b>
      <br>
      Based on more research on the media platform usage of our target audience, we decided to use Instagram and TikTok to promote our brand. Our posting days will be Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays at 6PM on Instagram and Tuesday, Friday and Sunday at 2PM on TikTok (Drucioc, 2024).  

<br><br>The posts we made consisted of Game Announcements and Pitch Reviews, meant to engage our community. Pitch Reviews are a series of videos where our team goes out and reviews pitches or game fields around Breda, to show our audience the playing opportunities they have. This is a unique concept that will certainly make our brand memorable for our audience. To ensure a good balance of posts and maximized reach, we will have one classic Instagram post followed by a reel, and we will post Pitch Reviews and follow video trends on TikTok.  

<br><br>The goal of game announcements was to nurture the community we are building. We want to show our users that we actively engage with them, organize games, and promote games for users. This goes back to the sense of belonging that is at the core of our brand 

<h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
        <p><b>Reach Objective:</b>  In terms of the reach objective, we set a low expectation for the accounts we anticipated to reach. On Instagram, we reached 757 users between the creation of our page and the 1st of April- roughly 650 more than predicted. On TikTok there is no direct metric to indicate the accounts reached but judging from our view count on each post, the average was approximately 689 views per post, so we met our goal on this platform as well. The Pitch Reviews were the content with the highest view count on both Instagram and TikTok.

        <div class="row mt-4">
          <div class="col-12">
            <p>A problem that this type of content (reels and videos on TikTok) had, however, was the low viewer retention rate. The analytics show that viewers clicked off after the first few seconds. In the next picture, you can see the reel insights of our most watched reel on instagram, and the audience retention rate dramatically falls after the first 20 seconds of the reel. Therefore, we need to find a way to make the Pitch Reviews more engaging for viewers so we mantain a good audience retention.</p>

            <img src="images/corporate/marketing/tiktok-retention.jpg" alt="tiktok retention" style="width:500px; height:550px">
            <p>The same happened on TikTok, where people quickly lost interest in our posts as seen in the engagement analytics. This is definitely something we need to keep in mind and fix for the future.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
          <br><br>
        <b>Affect Objective:</b>  The affect goal was not reached. At the end of the period, we got a total of 9/10 poll responses. A clear problem was the lack of polls we had- only 3. It is clear that if we had posted more polls, we would have reached the objective. 
        <br><br>
        <b>Response Objective:</b>  The response objective was also not reached. The total of followers we received was 59 on Instagram and only 4 on TikTok. Our analysis shows the main possible reason for this. Firstly, compared to other Brand Instagram accounts which managed to reach the 100 followers milestone in the same period, they simply had posted more. Even though the difference in regular post was not significant, where the separation really could be seen is in the number of stories. Another reason for not reaching the desired number of followers most likely is the repetition of content. Other than the first two posts we did not post anything else other than Pitch reviews and Game Announcements. Regarding TikTok followers, we could have gained more if we promoted the account on Instagram where most of our followers were. We also were too rigid in our plan and not willing to pivot- it was clear from likes that the one meme we posted was significantly more successful than the pitch reviews- 23 likes compared to an average of 5. 
       <br><br>
       The key takeaways of this analysis are that a diversification of content on both Instagram and TikTok would have been beneficial, and it would have boosted our following and viewership in an organic way. This, along with a better posting schedule and more constant posting, would have led to successfully surpassing our marketing objectives. However, one aspect that went well was the reach our posts had. Posting reels and videos proved to be a very effective way of reaching our target audience, and the analytics confirmed that the age range we chose as our target was accurate and effectively reached. 
       </p> 
       <h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>

        We believe that the first month showed the potential of our brand and if we implement some minor adjustments to our marketing strategy, we can boost the success we had. 

        Firstly, Pitch Reviews were an idea that is fresh and original, making our brand stand out and be memorable. The first step we can take in the future is to improve the production quality. Instagram Reels and TikTok are platforms where the posts have only the first few seconds to grab the viewer’s attention, so the first few seconds must be the most engaging or interesting. This means that additional editing, adding graphics and effects which are visually stimulating, would greatly increase the success of Pitch Reviews. An ambitious but certainly possible next step is to look for collaboration opportunities. We can reach out to local teams and suggest a collaboration where we rate the court/pitch/field they play on. 
      <br><br>
      Additionally, it would benefit us to have a greater variety of content to post. As outlined in “Learning Points”, the one meme we posted garnered the most likes from all our posts on both platforms. Therefore, it is worth experimenting further with this type of content. As Reels/TikTok's do such a great job of reaching new accounts, creating another series alongside Pitch Reviews could be a great improvement for our brand’s social media presence. 
      <br><br>
      Instagram stories also need to be improved, in terms of variety and frequency. So far, they only revolved around pitch reviews and only 5 stories were posted. In the future we plan on posting stories daily. We also plan to include more polls and questionaries to further engage with the viewers. 

      To boost TikTok engagement and followers we will also need to have more variety and a greater frequency. Furthermore, we should capitalize on promotion opportunities through Instagram- posting stories advertising our TikTok and linking it in the bio of the Instagram account. 
      <br><br>
      The following is a content schedule for the coming month adjusted in accordance with all the improvement points: <a href="https://edubuas-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/220248_buas_nl/EQOqR2rCM2RFuy6DCH6cNLMBbBYCjf-_tBmVjfpRfvGRUg?e=O8c8kn">Content Schedule Future Planning.xlsx</a>
